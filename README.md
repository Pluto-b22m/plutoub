# My Python Learning Journal

Hi! This is my personal journal where I write what I learn while studying Python.

I started this in May 2025 to track my progress and improve my programming skills step by step.

Each file is a simple note written in English about what I learned, what I practiced, and what I want to learn next.

More will come as I keep learning! ðŸš€
