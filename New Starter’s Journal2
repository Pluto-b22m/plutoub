#Learning Journal2 (2025.05.23)
Today, I learned about fundamental Python concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and function definitions, and applied them by creating small projects like a number guessing game and a simple calculator.

Among these topics, I found functions to be the most challenging at first, as understanding how to define and use them required some time and practice. However, by using them repeatedly in my projects, I gradually became more comfortable with the concept.

While creating the calculator, I encountered several syntax errors, which was frustrating at times. But once I fixed the issues and saw the program working correctly, I felt a strong sense of achievement.

Building these small projects on my own helped me become more interested in Python programming. It also gave me confidence that I can tackle more complex programs in the future.
I’m enjoying the process of becoming more familiar with computer programming, and I’m looking forward to learning more.
