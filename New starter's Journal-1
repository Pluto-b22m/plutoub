# Learning Journal - 1 (2025.05.22)

Today, I started learning Python.

I learned how to:
- use the `print()` function to display text,
- create and use variables,
- get user input using the `input()` function.

It was my first time writing code, and I had fun seeing how Python works.  
Some parts were confusing, but I enjoyed trying out simple examples.

In my next coding class, I will learn how `if` statements work.
